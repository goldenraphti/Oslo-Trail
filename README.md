## Instructions for the users

Oslo Trail Web-App

The goal of this web-app is to present the best trail running routes around Oslo. And offer additional features to the users.   
Filters to help choose the route they are looking for (distance, climb, loop/one-way).   
Decide which markers to display, showing the user the exact spotsto refill water, go to WC, or the most scenic viewpoints.   
Select each route individually clicking on its name. And undo that by clicking "show all route" button.   
Search for a route by entering location name in the search field, location being either start/finish or location crossed during the run. 

The web-app is a Single Page App. It's a progressive offline first web-app which means once you've been loading the content by navigating through the web-app all the datas loaded in the cache will still be available if you get offline. It actually ONLY load content if it is new content never previously loaded before. Perfect for your run, if you get off the signal but still want to know where you can find some  :potable_water: or  :toilet:.
